# Dockerising Projects

This repository documents my hands-on journey of learning and mastering **Docker** as part of my DevOps skill development.  
Rather than passively consuming tutorials, I believe in **learning by doing**.  

Here, I take projects from the book **[Full Stack React Projects - Second Edition](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Full-Stack-React-Projects-Second-Edition)** (published by Packt) and progressively **containerize** them using:

- **Docker** for containerization  
- **Docker Compose** for multi-service orchestration  

---

## Goals

- Gain practical, real-world experience with Docker.  
- Learn how to containerize different types of applications (frontend, backend, databases).  
- Understand how to run multi-service applications with Docker Compose.  
- Build a foundation for integrating Docker into CI/CD pipelines.  

---

## Why This Repo?

- Contains multiple full stack projects
- Provides accurate steps to run the full-stack projects.

## Credits

- Thanks to **Packt** for publishing the *Full Stack React Projects - Second Edition*, which provided this wondeeful collection of different projects.
